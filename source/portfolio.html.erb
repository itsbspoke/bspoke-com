        <p>A collaboration with <a href="http://workmontage.com">Work Montage</a>, Adam Howell had this to say about working with Jim Van Fleet, President of bspoke:</p>
        <blockquote><p>I&rsquo;ve been building and designing websites and web apps for years. Some have been successful. Most have not.</p>
        <p>Oftentimes I&rsquo;d go it alone, taking a project only as far as my programming abilities let me. Which is to say, not far.</p>
        <p>After a few years of being a one-man show without much to show for it, I teamed up with Jim to build Mocksup. It was a relief to work with someone who got stuff done as knowledgeably and thoroughly as he did.</p>
        <p>Mocksup launched just a couple months ago, but already has paying customers and hundreds of users. And it certainly wouldn&rsquo;t be where it is without Jim&rsquo;s online expertise and business savvy.</p></blockquote>

        <p>Casey Brooke-Bunn had a tough decision to make. Her previous developer had moved on. She had many options, but didn&rsquo;t know which opinions to trust.</p>
        <p>bspoke was able to coach her through determining the appropriate course of action for her business:</p>
        <blockquote><p>My company has seen its share of technology partners, and working with Jim is like a breath of fresh air.  He has the technical aptitude needed from both a planning and execution standpoint, and also the business knowledge to make sure my product is the best it can be.  He&rsquo;s able to communicate technicalities on an level I can understand and make suggestions for my best interest.  Jim is a trusted and a most valuable consultant.</p></blockquote>
